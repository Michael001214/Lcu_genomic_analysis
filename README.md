This project focuses on the genomic analysis of sex differences in *Litsea cubeba*, a dioecious plant whose sex can only be identified after flowering.  
The analysis consists of two main approaches:

1. ***k*-mer analysis** (reference genome–free)
2. **Reference genome–based analysis**

All scripts used in the analysis are organized into two corresponding folders.
The reference genome used for reference-based analyses is the *Litsea cubeba* genome assembly ASM1293172v1 (accession: [GCA_012931725.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_012931725.1/)), downloaded from NCBI. All sequence alignments and variant calling were conducted based on this version.

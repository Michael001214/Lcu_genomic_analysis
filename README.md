This project focuses on the genomic analysis of sex differences in *Litsea cubeba*, a dioecious plant whose sex can only be identified after flowering.  
The analysis consists of two main approaches:

1. **K-mer–based analysis** (reference genome–free)
2. **Reference genome–based analysis**

All scripts used in the analysis are organized into two corresponding folders.
